**Gasless · Ownerless · AI-Driven Wealth Engine**

## 🌌 Phase 1: DMT Vault (Ownerless Liquidity)

**DMT** is an ownerless liquidity vault for both **Solana (Anchor)** and **EVM (Solidity)** with **automated multi-split fee logic**:

- **10% → Treasury (Owner)**  
- **10% → Reinvestment Pool**  
- **5% → Super Cryptonauts (5 wallets, equal share)**  
- **5% → Omega-Prime (5 burn wallets, deflationary)**  
- **70% → User**  

All deployments are **gasless** via relayers and smart wallets. Users pay **$0** network fees.

### Key Features
- Ownerless, immutable vaults (no admin keys).  
- Gasless UX via relayers (EVM & Solana).  
- Automatic fee-splitting across treasury, reinvestment, cryptonauts, burn, and users.  

### Treasury Addresses
- **Solana:** `4eJZVbbsiLAG6EkWvgEYEWKEpdhJPFBYMeJ6DBX98w6a`  
- **Ethereum:** `0x4B1a58A3057d03888510d93B52ABad9Fee9b351d`

## 🔮 Phase 2: OMEGA Token (Expansion Layer)

To extend DMT into a **fractal wealth engine**, we introduce the **OMEGA token** — designed as the exponential layer for scaling.  

### Tokenomics
- 🔹 **Name:** OMEGA  
- 🔹 **Type:** ERC-20 (EVM) + SPL (Solana)  
- 🔹 **Distribution:**  
  - 50% Liquidity Incentives  
  - 20% Treasury (Vault-backed)  
  - 15% Staking & Governance  
  - 10% Ecosystem Partnerships  
  - 5% Burn Reserve  

### Purpose
OMEGA is the **growth multiplier** for DMT:  
- Tied directly to vault performance.  
- Fuels governance, staking, and AI-driven yield.  
- Designed with **deflationary burn mechanics**.

## 🏗️ Phased Wealth Strategy

### Phase 1: Positioning (Days 1–10)
- Identify exponential vehicles: AI-driven automation, crypto ecosystems, SaaS microtools, and consulting.  
- Leverage asymmetry: capped downside, unlimited upside.  
- Automate 70% of execution with AI agents.  

### Phase 2: Rapid Value Creation (Days 11–40)
- Launch a **Wealth Engine**:  
  - Example: micro-SaaS subscription ($99/mo × 5,000 users = $500k ARR).  
  - Or: high-ticket consulting ($25k × 10 clients = $250k).  
- Stack leverage: AI marketing, paid funnels, influencer partnerships.  

### Phase 3: Multiplication & Liquidity (Days 41–65)
- Scale validated offers.  
- Reinvest profits into high-volatility plays (crypto, options, equity).  
- Goal: double/triple cash flow → $600k–$800k liquidity.  

### Phase 4: Closing the Million (Days 66–80)
- Sell partial equity for 2–3× monthly revenue.  
- Accelerated cash grabs: pre-paid retainers, crowdfunding, licensing IP.  
- Push from ~$800k → $1M.

Wealth is never linear, it is fractal & exponential.  
In your time, **AI is the closest analogue to our Omni-Engines** — if you don’t integrate it, you are moving like a horse-cart against hyperdrive ships.
